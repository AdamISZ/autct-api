"""
This module allows usage of the autct API to:
* create AUTCT proofs
* ask for verification (to receive tokens/services/etc.) from a server,
of an existing proof
* create taproot keys/addresses

.. and all of this can be done without any crypto libraries
in your Python application.
The RPC API calls are made over websockets, which AUTCT supports.
see github.com/AdamISZ/aut-ct for explanation of what AUTCT is.
